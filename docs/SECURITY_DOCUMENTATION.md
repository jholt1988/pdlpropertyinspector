# Security Documentation - Property Inspector Authentication System

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Property Inspector application's authentication system.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Password Security

#### Password Hashing
- **Technology**: bcryptjs with 12 salt rounds
- **Implementation**: All passwords are hashed before storage using industry-standard bcrypt algorithm
- **Protection**: Protects against rainbow table attacks and provides computational cost to slow down brute force attacks

#### Password Strength Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters length
- Must contain uppercase letters (A-Z)
- Must contain lowercase letters (a-z)
- Must contain numbers (0-9)
- Must contain special characters (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?)
- Maximum 128 characters (prevents DoS attacks)
- Rejects common patterns and weak passwords

### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization

#### Email Validation
- RFC 5322 compliant regex validation
- Length limits to prevent abuse
- Malicious pattern detection
- Case normalization

#### General Input Sanitization
- HTML tag removal using DOMPurify
- XSS prevention through content sanitization
- Length limits on all input fields
- Character whitelisting for names and structured data

### 3. Authentication Token Management

#### JWT Implementation
- **Access Tokens**: Short-lived (15 minutes) for API access
- **Refresh Tokens**: Long-lived (7 days) for token renewal
- **Token Rotation**: Refresh tokens are invalidated after use
- **Secure Headers**: HS256 algorithm with proper issuer/audience validation

#### Session Management
- Unique session IDs for each login
- Token family tracking for security
- Automatic session cleanup
- Session invalidation on logout

### 4. Rate Limiting and Brute Force Protection

#### Multi-Layer Rate Limiting
- **Login Attempts**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes, 30-minute block
- **Registration**: 3 attempts per hour
- **Password Reset**: 3 attempts per hour
- **Account Locking**: 10 failed attempts locks account for 1 hour

#### IP-Based Protection
- Rate limiting by IP address
- Suspicious activity tracking
- Automatic cleanup of expired records

### 5. Email Verification System

#### Verification Process
- Secure token generation for email verification
- Time-limited verification tokens
- Account restrictions until email is verified
- Resend capability with rate limiting

### 6. Database Security

#### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only access their own data
- Property managers have elevated permissions
- Secure policy enforcement at database level

#### Data Protection
- Password hashes never exposed in API responses
- Sensitive tokens stored securely
- Proper indexing for performance without exposing data

### 7. Audit and Monitoring

#### Comprehensive Logging
- All authentication attempts logged
- User actions tracked
- Security events monitored
- Failed attempts and blocks recorded

#### Automatic Cleanup
- Expired sessions removed automatically
- Old audit logs archived
- Rate limit records cleaned up
- Account locks automatically expire

## Security Best Practices Followed

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security validation
- Client-side and server-side validation
- Database-level security policies
- Network-level protections

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege
- Users only access their own resources
- Role-based permissions
- Granular access controls
- Secure defaults

### 3. Fail Securely
- Secure error handling without information leakage
- Generic error messages for authentication failures
- Proper logging without exposing sensitive data
- Graceful degradation

### 4. Zero Trust Architecture
- Every request validated and authenticated
- No implicit trust based on network location
- Continuous verification of user identity
- Least privilege access controls

## Vulnerability Protections

### 1. SQL Injection
- **Protection**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage
- **Implementation**: All database queries use prepared statements

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Protection**: Input sanitization using DOMPurify
- **Implementation**: All user input sanitized before storage and display

### 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Protection**: JWT tokens with proper validation
- **Implementation**: State-changing requests require valid authentication tokens

### 4. Session Hijacking
- **Protection**: Secure session management with token rotation
- **Implementation**: Short-lived access tokens and refresh token rotation

### 5. Brute Force Attacks
- **Protection**: Rate limiting and account locking
- **Implementation**: Simple blocking after reaching the configured `maxAttempts`.
  No progressive delay is currently implemented.

### 6. Timing Attacks
- **Protection**: Consistent timing for authentication operations
- **Implementation**: Dummy operations for failed authentication attempts

## Production Deployment Security

### 1. Environment Variables
```bash
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-random-jwt-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
```

### 2. HTTPS Configuration
- All authentication endpoints require HTTPS
- Secure cookie flags for production
- HSTS headers for enhanced security

### 3. Security Headers
```javascript
// Example security headers
{
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
  'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'"
}
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### 1. Security Events to Monitor
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Account lockouts
- Unusual login patterns
- Token refresh failures
- Password reset abuse

### 2. Automated Responses
- Automatic account locking
- Rate limit enforcement
- Session invalidation
- Alert generation for suspicious activity

## Regular Security Maintenance

### 1. Token Rotation
- Regular refresh token rotation
- Automatic cleanup of expired tokens
- Session timeout enforcement

### 2. Database Maintenance
- Regular cleanup of expired records
- Audit log archival
- Performance monitoring

### 3. Security Updates
- Regular dependency updates
- Security patch management
- Vulnerability scanning

## Testing Security Measures

### 1. Authentication Testing
- Password strength validation
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- Token expiration handling
- Session management

### 2. Authorization Testing
- Role-based access controls
- Data isolation between users
- API endpoint security
- Database policy enforcement

### 3. Input Validation Testing

- **SOX**: Audit trails and access controls
- **HIPAA**: Data security and access logging (if applicable)

## Emergency Procedures

### 1. Security Incident Response
1. Identify and contain the incident
2. Assess the scope and impact
3. Notify relevant stakeholders
4. Implement corrective measures
5. Document lessons learned

### 2. Account Recovery
- Secure password reset process
- Manual account unlock procedures
- Emergency access protocols
- Backup authentication methods

## Conclusion

This authentication system implements industry best practices for web application security, providing multiple layers of protection against common attacks while maintaining usability and performance. Regular security reviews and updates ensure the system remains secure against evolving threats.
